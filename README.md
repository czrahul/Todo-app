# Getting Started with Create React App

This is a todo-app where we can store our tasks which we often forget to do. 

To run this app first you have to download the [server.js](https://github.com/czrahul/Todo-app/blob/main/server.js) file in this repo and run in your machine.

Run this server.js file using command "node server.js" if you have nodejs installed in your system 

Otherwise install it using this guid https://nodejs.org/en/download/

I have hosted my app on Netlify, so after successfully running the server file hit this link https://work-board.netlify.app/

Now, you use the todo app
